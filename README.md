### Description

An image uploading service that allows users to add images directly from their devices and store them within the application, courtesy of Amazon's S3 service!

### Tech used
- Ruby
- Rails
- Paperclip gem
- HTML
- CSS
- AWS - Specifically S3

### Features
- User authentication allows for separation of users and their images. Users can also update their profiles on the site.
- Use of S3 allows persistance of images. Users can log out and have their images be there when they log in again!
- Paperclip allows users to select files off of their computer and makes default sizing so all the images are consistent.

### Future Implementations
- Interactivity between users! Users can view each other's profiles and like one another's photos!
- Filters! Like a popular photo app, let users put filters on their pictures before uploading.
- Nav bar to place edit profile and logout links.
